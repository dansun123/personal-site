### Intro

I am an MIT undergraduate student studying 6-3 Computer Science and Engineering. Projected to graduate in 2022, I aim to continue working on cool projects, a pursuit I have only recently stumbled across. Since I started learning web development in 2020, I have created [Interstellar](https://interstellar.live), [DJZoomer](https://djzoomer.herokuapp.com), [Partyy](http://partyy.life), [QuickMaths](http://quickmaths.live), and I am currently working on CardBox, a sandbox mode interface for playing card games.
<br>
I am always available to explore interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, and games. If you would like to arrange a meeting, please reach out to me via email. I am based in Boston but travel to New York and San Diego frequently.
<br><br>

### Current Projects

With CardBox and my previous projects, I have learned how to manage teams, build relationships with users, sell enterprise products, and build databases for production environments. I plan to continue on with these, as well as any new project ideas that I stumble across along the way!

### Some history

- In 2005, I got a GameBoy with Pokemon Emerald for my 5th birthday. That was my first memory of using an electronic device, and I loved it. Since then, I've taken a break from gaming (unless chess counts as a game), but in the past I have played Tetris, Bloons Tower Defense, HearthStone, League of Legends, and, of course, a lot more Pokemon.

- In 2006, I believed that I was endowed with the power to control the weather, since my last name was Sun, so I studied a lot of meteorology and thought that I would become a superhero like Storm.

- In 2007, I sent my first email from my mom's email account. It was to apply to a nation-wide SeaWorld writing competition, in which my essay somehow managed to scrape a second place award. I thought at that point I would become a writer.

- In 2008, my basketball team won a tournament in San Diego. I loved the game, and promised myself that I would one day play in the NBA. To accomplish this, I decided I needed to be at least 6'2'', so I forced down 3 cups of milk day... today, I am 5'11'' and lactose intolerant.

- In 2010, I placed first in a statewide chess tournament and took home a trophy taller than my 4'9'' frame, and way heavier than I could carry. I thought at that point I would become a professional chess player.

- In the summer of 2011, I made my very first email address, fractalman2000@gmail.com, to stay in touch with my friends that I had met at my first summer camp.

- At age 11, I realized that math is cool. After making an account on [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/), I spent a lot of time playing For The Win! This led me to nearly get suspended from school for ditching class too many times to play For The Win! in my middle school media center.

- At age 13, I got my first computer. I played a lot of League of Legends and Hearthstone that summer. I was hitting streamer-level arena runs in Hearthstone, whereas I was probably the least competent League of Legends player in my high school friend group.

- At age 15, I took AP Computer Science and learned for the first time how to code using Java. I spent most of my time in this class playing minesweeper (where I managed to beat expert mode in 79.41 seconds!!!) and eventually coded up my very own implementation of it in Java (with a much worse UI).

- That same year, I took the USA Math Olympiad for the first time, and scraped by to qualify for the [Math Olympiad Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Program) (MOP). I discovered a love for the cardgame, [Fish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_(card_game)>), and proceeded to win the MOP Fish tournament, taking down the undefeated team from the previous year.

- At age 16, I decided that I wanted to qualify for every olympiad training camp, so I studied Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, qualifying for all 4 olympiads. But on each olympiad, I missed camp by a hair. At this point, I decided to scrap olympiads and do some research... Research was a bust.

- At age 17, I applied and got into my dream school, MIT. I spent the rest of my senior year socializing and playing a lot of [Avalon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)#Avalon_variant>). This was also the year I discovered that I liked climbing buildings, which led to quite a few late-night adventures, culminating in a run-in with the police.

- In college, at age 18, I completed my first two graduate classes (Machine Learning; Inference and Information) and wrote my first programs in Python and C++. Then I proceeded to spend the summer studying options theory and developing features for Akuna Capital. We also skipped work to do a roadtrip to the South, on which I learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. I also got two concussions this year, which was really annoying and a bit silly because of how they occurred; basically, I was being an idiot.

- After turning 19, I upgraded my computer from an old, beat-up brick of a laptop to a sleek macbook pro. I also learned some web-development, and deployed my [first website](https://dansun123.github.io/flappy/). As you can see, I got started with building real things very late!

- In March of 2020, I was evicted from college and stranded in isolation. To pass the time, I learned how to do a handstand, cut my own hair for the first time (that got mixed reviews), and made this website.

You can ask me in person for other stories that would not be suitable to share on the internet.

### Fun facts

- I record every action of my day in my google calendar, with color codes, to keep myself accountable for how I spend my time
- My first name was almost "Bright" because my parents wanted my name to be "Bright Sun" (I'm thinking about naming my child Capri ðŸ¤§)
- I learned that I was lactose intolerant in college, after drinking 3 glasses of milk a day for 18 years of my life
- I love trick shots, and have been compiling a few of my own. (Will attach a video here later)

### I dream of

- finding inspiration
- equality/justice amongst people of all races and genders
- the future, and the past
- flying and teleporting around the world
- dunking basketballs and muscle ups
